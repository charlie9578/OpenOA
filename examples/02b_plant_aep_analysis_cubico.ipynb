    "This notebook provides an overview and walk-through of the steps taken to produce a plant-level operational energy asssessment (OA) of a wind plant, using the open data available for [Kelmarsh](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5841833) and [Penmanshiel](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5946807).\n",

    "Uncertainty in the annual energy production (AEP) estimate is calculated through a Monte Carlo approach. Specifically, inputs into the OA code as well as intermediate calculations are randomly sampled based on their specified or calculated uncertainties. By performing the OA assessment thousands of times under different combinations of the random sampling, a distribution of AEP values results from which uncertainty can be deduced. Details on the Monte Carlo approach will be provided throughout this notebook.\n",

    "**Note**: If the data is not already available on your computer, be sure to install the additionally required packages `cdsapi` (ERA5 API library) and `xarray` (data handling for NetCDF data). This can be done via `pip install \"openoa[weather]\"` to have have it managed through the OpenOA installation process."

    "Data is downloaded automatically from Zenodo for the wind farm data and from GES DISC and CDS for the long-term reanalysis data. These are then stored in the 'examples/data' folder under the asset names. Note this includes all available data, and so for the 2 assets uses about 20 GB of space in total. The first time this notebook is run it could therefore take a signficant amount of time to download the data (e.g. over an hour). Its recommended that you leave it to run, then restart and run-all to clear the download messages. For downloading the GES DISC and CDS long-term reanalysis data registration is also required, see: [GES DISC registration](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/data-access#python-requests) and [CDS registration](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to)."

Specifically, we identify each source of uncertainty in the OA estimate and use that uncertainty to create distributions of the input and intermediate variables from which we can sample for each iteration of the OA code. For input variables, we can create such distributions beforehand. For intermediate variables, we must sample separately for each iteration.\n",

    "Detailed descriptions of the sampled Monte Carlo inputs, which can be specified when initializing the MonteCarloAEP object if values other than the defaults are desired, are provided below:\n",
    "\n",
    " - uncertainty_meter : Revenue meter energy measurements are associated with a measurement uncertainty of around 0.5%. This uncertainty is used to create a distribution centered at 1 (and with standard deviation therefore of 0.005). This column represents random samples from that distribution. For each iteration of the OA code, a value from this column is multiplied by the monthly revenue meter energy data before the data enter the OA code, thereby capturing the 0.5% uncertainty.\n",
    " \n",
    " - uncertainty_losses : Reported availability and curtailment losses are estimates and are associated with uncertainty. For now, we assume the reported values are associated with an uncertainty of 5%. Similar to above, we therefore create a distribution centered at 1 (with std of 0.05) from which we sample for each iteration of the OA code. These sampled values are then multiplied by the availability and curtaiment data independently before entering the OA code to capture the 5% uncertainty in the reported values.\n",
    " \n",
    " - uncertainty_windiness : This intends to capture the uncertainty associated with the number of historical years an analyst chooses to use in the windiness correction. The industry standard is typically 20 years and is based on the assumption that year-to-year wind speeds are uncorrelated. However, a growing body of research suggests that there is some correlation in year-to-year wind speeds and that there are trends in the resource on the decadal timescale. To capture this uncertainty both in the long-term trend of the resource and the analyst choice, we randomly sample integer values betweeen 10 and 20 as the number of years to use in the windiness correction.\n",
    " \n",
    " - uncertainty_loss_max : Due to uncertainty in reported availability and curtailment estimates, months with high combined losses are associated with high uncertainty in the calculated gross energy. It is common to remove such data from analysis. For this analysis, we randomly sample float values between 0.1 and 0.2 (i.e. 10% and 20%) to serve as criteria for the combined availability and curtailment losses. Specifically, months are excluded from analysis if their combined losses exceeds that criteria for the given OA iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    " - uncertainty_nan_energy: Threshold for removing days/months based on the fraction of NaNs in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - outlier_detection: Whether to perform (True) or not (False) outlier detection filtering. The default value is set to False.\n",
    "\n",
    " - uncertainty_outlier : Sample values between 1 and 3 which set the Huber algorithm outlier detection parameter (for linear regression; for machine learning regression algorithms, please see example 2b). Varying this threshold accounts for analyst subjectivity on what data points constitute outliers and which do not.\n",
    "  \n",
    " - reanalyis_product : This captures the uncertainty of using different reanalysis products and, lacking a better method, is a proxy way of capturing uncertainty in the modelled monthly wind speeds. For each iteration of the OA code, one of the reanalysis products that we've already determined as valid (see the cells above) is selected.\n",
    " \n",
    "Finally, we note that the operational data are also randomly resampled at each iteration using bootstrapping to help quantify uncertainty in the results. Consequently, different slope and intercept values for the linear regression model mapping monthly wind speed to energy production are determined each Monte Carlo iteration."
